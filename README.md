# Asking Reflective Questions in ArtQuest


This repository will host the resources and code designed for asking reflective questions in ArtQuest.

A demo version is available at https://nlp-platform.online/artquest3/


QANLI dataset is described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02922. This dataset
was used to learn to convert (QA) pairs to declarative sentences.

Most of our models are based on the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer or T5 (https://huggingface.co/t5-large)
described in this paper: https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf


Guides based on which the generic cues and question templates were designed:
