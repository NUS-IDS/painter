This painting is titled Self-Portrait (c. 1915) .
Max Liebermann was born in Berlin to a rich Jewish family at a time when Jews were oppressed .
He was a young adult when laws were changed in 1871 and Jews were granted the same rights as other German citizens .
His Realist paintings depicted working people as they actually were — not idealized or denigrated — and were seen as subversive .
In the German parliament , Liebermann ’s Twelve - Year - Old Jesus in the Temple ( 1879 ) was condemned as blasphemous because his Jesus was said to be “ too Jewish looking . ”
In Self -Portrait ( in the Uffizi ) , Liebermann shows himself as a confident , determined man .
The background of palette , easel , and cloth is painted impressionistically , but his own image is painted in a more realistic style —he is the main focus , the viewer must not be distracted by anything .
After Liebermann ’s death , the Hitler regime removed his works from German art galleries .
